Snolt --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attack: 5
Snail that replaces the normal starter slime typically found in RPGs. Neutral, but when provoked, sends out shockwave
which attacks player with an AOE. Shockwave will stun player, deals 5 damage per second (amend this) - but will not 
move when charging up up for shockwave, which takes a millisecond.

Hyperlock -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A high level ability that allows you restrain the area in which an entity can move in. Prevents teleportation
out of designated area when upgraded to a sufficient level. Requires a sacrifice to activate - a section of the health
bar can be used.

Glimpse -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A creature famous for teleporting to get to places. Neutral until provoked, the nature of their attacks is
dependent on the environment around them. Very dangerous when provoked. Translucent, shapeshifts constantly (even more so
when attacking) and radiates light of an ambience based off of its environment. High level enemy.

Sentry --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Golem whose sole task is to defend whatever it has been assigned to with its life. However, if left too long without a
directional energy recharge, the energy controlling its directions will fade, and it will lie dormant until provoked - 
giving it the title "Abandoned Sentry". Provoking a Sentry includes waking an Abandoned Sentry, attacking a Sentry or
attacking what it is supposed to defend.

Fabrication Dimension -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Brain wave how about a having a level made out of fabric".
"And sword slashes downward rip the road in half"
"Takes 2 hours to regenerate"
Enough said.

Flowerbell ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Restoration item
- The bell creates a melody that restores mana and gives buffs, and the pollen inside restores health
	- Agility + 1 (amend this)
	- Health Per Second + 1 for 20 seconds (amend this)
	- Mana Per Second + 1 for 20 seconds (amend this)

Item Mechanics ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Swords ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		- Blades can be swapped to allow different buffs
		- Breaking blades can be switched to drop the lowering durability of the hilt
- Blacksmithing and switching skills offer higher crafting buffs to those who use them.
